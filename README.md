During the season player can discuss strategy and make deals with each other.
Once a player has decided on his actions for the season, he fills out the command sheet.

A season concludes when all players submit their command sheets or when the allotted time has ended.

### Actions

* Attack - Troop attacks a neighboring territory (does not have to be occupied). 
* Assist - The troop assists a different troop (does not have to be of same army) to attack a neighboring territory.<br/>

### Settings

* Spectator Mode - Sets the current device into spectator mode. This device will not be used by one of the player. Instead it can be connected to a T.V. or a large screen.

* Seasons Per Year - Determines how many seasons will be played in each year. Since sprouting new units only happens before the Fall season, playing 4 seasons a year makes the game more difficult.

* Season Length - How long will each season be (Minutes).

* First Season Length - How long will the first season be (Minutes). For new players we recommend double the length of a regular season.
