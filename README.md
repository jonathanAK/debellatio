### Settings

* Spectator Mode - Sets the current device into spectator mode. This device will not be used by one of the player. Instead it can be connected to a T.V. or a large screen.

* Seasons Per Year - Determines how many seasons will be played in each year. Since sprouting new units only happens before the Fall season, playing 4 seasons a year makes the game more difficult.

* Maximum Number Of players - Maximum number of players allowed between 2 and 7. The game master may choose to start the game even if less player have joined the game.

* Season Length - How long will each season be (Minutes).

* First Season Length - How long will the first season be (Minutes). For new players we recommend double the length of a regular season.
